### Terms

strain_time: the real delta time(ms) between two hit objects. e.g. 300BPM Jump: 60 / 300 * 1/2 = 100, 200BPM Stream: 60 / 200 * 1/4 = 75.

hit_window: overall_difficulty, representing the hit range that players should follow.

### Ideas

1. Nerf wide angle stream (circle stream), since it's much easier in relax.
1. Nerf velocity bonus in acute angle calculation, since relax is not so that sensitive with velocity.
1. Include relax rhythm evaluator
